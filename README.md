# HSWM-Minecraft
## Description
Welcome to the open codes for the Hard Survival Weather Mod Minecraft. Add this to your Minecraft World game and try to beat the ender dragon and beat minecraft as you would normally do. 

## FAQ
1. Cannot stop? Well first you should have edited the code and add /stop after command ('/stopmod'). Please add this before trying the mod out. If you are already in the game with the mod with no command to stop, beat the game to end this, or delete your world. Or else each world you create will be having this mod only whether you select the creative and easy modes.
2. Only 5 cheat codes? Yes but you can create your own by entering /mycode.cheatcode.(ifmycodeistrue?)enable(yes?).so.

## Rules
There are no rules, unless you wanna get stuck in the game forever LOL.
